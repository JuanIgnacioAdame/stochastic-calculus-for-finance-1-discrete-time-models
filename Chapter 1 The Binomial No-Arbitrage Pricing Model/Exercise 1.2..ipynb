    "Suppose in the situation of Example 1.1.1 that the option sells for 1.20 at time zero.  In other words, suppose there is a European call option with price $V_0=1.20$ at time zero, and $V_1=\\text{max}\\{0,S_1-K\\}:=(S_1-K)^{+}$ where the strike price $K=5$.  Consider an agent who begins with wealth $X_0=0$ and at time zero buys $\\Delta_0$ shares of stock and $\\Gamma_0$ options.  The numbers $\\Delta_0$ and $\\Gamma_0$ can be either positive or negative or zero.  This leaves the agent with a cash position of $-4\\Delta_0-1.20\\Gamma_0$.  If this is positive, it is invested in the money market; if it is negative, it represents money borrowed from the money market.  At time one, the value of the agent's portfolio of stock, option, and money market assets is \\\n",

    "Assume that both $H$ and $T$ have positive probability of occurring.  Show that if there is apositive probability that $X_1$ is positive, then there is a positive probability that $X_1$ is negative.  In other words, one cannot find an arbitrage when the time-zero price of the option is 1.20."
