    "Consider the American put of Example 4.2.1, which has strike price 5.  Suppose at time zero we sell this put to a purchaser who has inside information about the stock movements and uses the exercise rule $\\rho$ of (4.3.2).  In particular, if the first toss is going to result in $H$, the owner of the put exercises at time zero, when the put has intrinsic value $1$.  If the first toss results in $T$ and the second toss is going to result in $H$, the owner exercise at time one, when the put has intrinsic value $3$.  If the the first two tosses result in $TT$, the owner exercies at time two, when the intrinsic value is 4. In summary, the owner of the put has the payoff random variable\n",

All the various theorems assume this condition holds, and hence we cannot use our usual suite of theorems to price $Y$."

    "The pricing methodology used in the example is further justified by Theorem 4.4.3 and Theorem 4.4.5.  More specifically, Theorem 4.4.3 says the the price is acceptable to the seller because she can construct a hedging portfolio with initial capital 1.36.  Theorem 4.4.5 says that the price is acceptable to the buyer because it is possible to find an exercise policy that is a genuine stopping time (i.e. one that does not make use of insider information) such that the risk-neutral expectation of the future-discounted cashflows she will recieve in the future, according to this exercise policy, is equal to 1.36."
