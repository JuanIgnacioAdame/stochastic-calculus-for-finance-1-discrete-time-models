    "For the class of derivative securities in Exercise 4.6 whose time-zero price is given by (4.8.3), let $G_n=S_n-K$.  This derivative security permits its owner to buy one share of stock in exchange for a payment of $K$ at any time up to the expiration time $N$.  If the purchase has not been made at time $N$, it must be made then.  Determine the time-zero value and optimal exercise policy for this derivative security."

    "Similar to what we did for Exercise 4.6 (i), we will first show that the discounted intrinsic value process $X_n:=\\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}G_n$ is a submartingale (in Exercise 4.6 (i) we showed the revelant process was a *super*martingale).  Using Theorem 4.3.3, this tells us $\\mathbb{E}X_{n\\land \\tau}\\leq\\mathbb{E}X_n$.  If we let $n=N$, this becomes $\\mathbb{E}X_{N\\land \\tau}\\leq\\mathbb{E}X_N\\Rightarrow\\mathbb{E}X_{\\tau}\\leq\\mathbb{E}X_N$.  This tells us that $\\tau^{*}\\equiv N$, which yields a time-zero value for this derivative of\n",

    "*A Remark*.  Note that in general the equality $X_{N\\land\\tau}=X_\\tau$ we used above does not hold for American derivatives, as it is not necessary that they be exercised.  In other words, for an American derivative security, it is possible that $\\tau=\\infty$, and hence it is not necessarily the case that $N\\land\\tau=\\tau$."
