    "Let $1\\leq m\\leq N-1$ and $K>0$ be given. A *chooser option* is a contract sold at time zero that confers on its owner the right to receive either a call or a put at time $m$. The owner of the chooser may wait until time $m$ before choosing. The call or put chosen expires at time $N$ with strike price $K$. Show that the time-zero price of a chooser option is the sum of the time-zero price of a put, expiring at time $N$ and having strike price $K$, and a call, expiring at time $m$ and having strike price $\\frac{K}{(1+r)^{N-m}}$."

First, we show how one can replicate the portfolio for times $m+1,m+2,\\dots,N-1,N$.  Then we show one can replicate the portfolio for times $0,1,\\dots,m-1,m$."

The first observation to make that will help us is to note that the no-arbitrage condition requires that the owner of such an option will, at time $m$, choose the contract (i.e. either the call or the put) that maximizes his or her wealth.  In other words, if $V_m$ denotes the value of the chooser contract at time $m$, it must hold that\n",

    "We claim that a derivative with such a payoff can be replicated for times $0,1,\\dots,m-1,m$ by buying, at time zero, a put with strike price $K$ that expires at time $N$, and a call with strike price $\\frac{K}{(1+r)^{N-m}}$ that expires at time $m$.  Let $V'_m$ be the payoff of such a proposed replicating portfolio.  Recall from Theorem 2.4.7 that discounted derivatives prices are martinagles under the risk-neutral measure.  Additionally, recall from Exercise 2.8(i) that if two martingales are equal for some time $m$, then in fact they are equal for all times $0,1,\\dots,m-1,m$.  Hence if we can show that $V'_m\\stackrel{!}{=}V_m$, we will have that $V'_0=V_0$, and this is the time-zero value of the chooser option."
