    "The Lagrange Multiplier Theorem used in the solution of Problem 3.3.5 has hypotheses that we did not verify in the solution of that problem.  In particular, the theorem states that if the gradient of the constraint function, which in this case is the vector $(p_1\\zeta_a,\\dots,p_m\\zeta_m)$, is not the zero vector, then the optimal solution must satisfy the Lagrange multipler equations (3.3.22).  This gradient is not the zero vector, so this hypothesis is satisfied.  However, wven when this hypothesis is satisfied, the theorem does not guarantee that there is an optimal solution; the solution to the Lagrange multiplier equations may in fact minimize the expected utility.  The solution could also be neither a maximizer nor a minimizer.  Therefore, in this exercise, we outline a different method for verifying that the random varaible $X_N$ given by (3.3.25) maximizes the expected utility."
